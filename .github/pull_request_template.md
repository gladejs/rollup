Thank you very much for your hard work, please follow these simple instructions.

## CommitLog
Explain your contribution as an idealized commit log or a tasks TODO list.
Use a checkbox list to plan and communicate on your progress in a Draft PR.
Note that the better your actual commits, the lesser you need to write here.

## Reasoning
If you can justify the proposed modification in a few paragraphs, do so here.
Otherwise, simply write "Fixes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>" or "Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>".
If necessary, save this PR as a Draft, open a new issue, then use its number.

## Checklist
 - [ ] Documentation: is it properly updated ? do missing docs have open issues ?
 - [ ] Testing: to be done "by hand" and on your honnor for now, 'npm test' later
 - [ ] Linting: proper indentation will do for now, 'npm run lint' probably later


REMINDER: read the "CONTRIBUTING.md" document _before_ submitting a Pull Request.
