Thank you very much for your hard work, please follow these simple instructions.

## CommitLog

Explain your contribution as an idealized commit log or a tasks TODO list.
Use a checkbox list to plan and communicate on your progress in a Draft PR.
Note that the better your actual commits, the lesser you need to write here.

## Reasoning

If you can justify the proposed modification in a few paragraphs, do so here.
Otherwise, simply write "Fixes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>" or "Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>".
If necessary, save this PR as a Draft, open a new issue, then use its number.

## Checklist

-   [ ] Testing: no automated tests yet, but you did test, didn't you ?
-   [ ] Linting: did you "npm run lint" ? because GitHub will for sure.
-   [ ] Documentation: is it updated or are there related open issues ?

REMINDER: read the "CONTRIBUTING.md" document _before_ you submit a Pull Request.
